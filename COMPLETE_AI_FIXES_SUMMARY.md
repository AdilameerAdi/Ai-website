### Technical Implementation:

#### Enhanced Smart Reply System:
```javascript
// Before: Static template selection
const replies = ["Thank you for contacting us..."];

// After: Dynamic content analysis
const issueTypes = {
  login: { keywords: ['login', 'password'], responses: [...] },
  technical: { keywords: ['bug', 'error'], responses: [...] }
};
// Analyzes content and selects appropriate response
```

#### Dynamic Pricing Analysis:
```javascript
// Before: Static recommendations
recommendations: ["Consider bundling maintenance services..."]

// After: Project-specific logic  
if (basePrice > 20000) {
  recommendations.push('Consider phased implementation...');
} else {
  recommendations.push('Bundle additional features...');
}
```

#### Data-Driven Insights:
```javascript
// Before: Fixed percentages
'Revenue increased by 12%'

// After: Calculated from user data
const revenue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 5;
`Projected revenue growth of ${revenue}% based on current proposal pipeline`
```
