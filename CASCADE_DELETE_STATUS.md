# CASCADE DELETE STATUS REPORT

## âœ… Current Database Configuration

Your database **ALREADY HAS** CASCADE DELETE properly configured! Here are the tables that will automatically delete user data when a user is deleted:

### Tables with CASCADE DELETE (ON DELETE CASCADE):
- `proposals` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `proposal_line_items` â†’ proposal_id references proposals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE  
- `proposal_templates` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `tickets` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `files` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `notifications` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `user_activities` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- `user_sessions` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

### Tables with CASCADE DELETE (ON DELETE CASCADE) - UPDATED:
- `feedback` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE âœ… FIXED
- `leads` â†’ assigned_to references users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE âœ… FIXED

### Tables with SET NULL (ON DELETE SET NULL):
- `audit_logs` â†’ user_id references users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL (preserves audit trail)

### Tables with No User Reference:
- `email_templates` â†’ created_by references users(id) (but can be NULL)
- `system_settings` â†’ updated_by references users(id) (but can be NULL)

## ðŸ”§ What Happens When Admin Deletes a User:

When you delete a user from the admin panel:

1. **User record** is deleted from `users` table
2. **All user's proposals** are automatically deleted (CASCADE)
3. **All proposal line items** for those proposals are deleted (CASCADE)
4. **All user's proposal templates** are deleted (CASCADE)
5. **All user's tickets** are deleted (CASCADE)
6. **All user's files** are deleted (CASCADE)
7. **All user's notifications** are deleted (CASCADE)
8. **All user's activity logs** are deleted (CASCADE)
9. **All user's sessions** are deleted (CASCADE)
10. **All user's feedback** is deleted (CASCADE) âœ… UPDATED
11. **All leads assigned to user** are deleted (CASCADE) âœ… UPDATED
12. **Audit logs** keep user_id set to NULL (preserves audit trail)

## âœ… Admin Function Already Working:

The `confirmDeleteUser` function in `AdminUsers.jsx` already works correctly:

```javascript
const confirmDeleteUser = async () => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from("users")
    .delete()
    .eq("id", selectedUser.id);
  // This automatically triggers CASCADE DELETE for all related data
};
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion:

**CASCADE DELETE has been updated to meet user requirements!** When you delete a user from the admin panel, ALL their related data including:
- âœ… Tickets
- âœ… Proposals  
- âœ… Files
- âœ… Notifications
- âœ… **Feedback** (now CASCADE DELETE instead of SET NULL)
- âœ… **Leads** (now CASCADE DELETE)

Will be automatically deleted due to the foreign key constraints.

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - User deletion now removes notifications, feedback, and ALL related data as requested.
